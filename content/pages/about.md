title: About Me

Hi, 
I’m Gen but those closest to me call me Gee Gee. I am a writer, creative, and educator who lives life out loud and unapologetically. I have had a love affair with and appreciation for words as an art form for as long as I can remember.  That love and appreciation are what drew me to not only writing but to inspiring others to do so as well. My desire to manifest that creativity is what fueled me to begin publishing my work.  Thus my first book “Light Up the Darkness” was born.
