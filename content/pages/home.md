bookDescription: Light in the Darkness takes you deep into the mind and spirit
  of the author with this non-traditional poetic and prose collection. It
  provides readers with an accurate and realistic depiction of pain and
  pleasure, of violence and tranquility, and of emotional connections to even
  the intangible.  This body of work, of art, sheds light on and embodies the
  stories that no one likes to tell, the ones that stay in the dark. This
  collection lights up the darkness.

    review: These poems express your message in a unique way, often with rhythm or
      rhyme. Because of my life experience "I KNOW IT WASNT YOUR FAULT" touched
      me deeply. However my favorite in your collection is "GENERATIONAL CRIES".
      However I found each poem to be highly descriptive, your use of language
      created images and feelings. While you have been transparent with your
      emotions you have placed that secondary to delivering it in a manner that
      does not get in the way of the visual imagery your use of vocabulary
      provokes.

    review: Light up the darkness is a well put together book of poems which is
      reminiscent of a memoir. Gee Gee Louis touches on her life experiences
      with faith and love and many other feeling, in such a way that any reader
      can resonate with her words and feelings. A self-help book that embodies
      ones journey from hurting to healing, from feeling invisible to being
      seen, I recommend this book to anyone who is scared to leave, dealing with
      self-doubt or who just needs a reminder that they too are worthy.
