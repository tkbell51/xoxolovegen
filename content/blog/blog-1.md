Wow, my website is finally here. It has definitely been a process that was both inspiring and very much needed.  Developing this website was such a task in that I had no clue why I needed a website, I just knew that I needed one.  As my team and I began diving deeper and deeper into what I wanted, we realized all I really wanted was for my voice and my work to no longer be just for me.  So I wanted a way to introduce everyone that wanted to be a part of the process to me and my voice reaching as many people as possible. So what can you expect?  One of our visions is to also have this platform as a way to introduce you to other artists we meet along the way with our artist spotlight that will be introduced soon.  Besides that, well, I’m a writer so you’ll have access to content and updates on my writing process and projects/books/engagements.  You’ll also have updates on non-writing related projects that I am working on.  Besides that you’ll periodically see tips and tricks that I’ve learned over the years for breaking writing/creative blocks and developing content. The added bonus…. You’ll also get to know me on a more personal level as I continue working through this journey we call life.  Since you’re already here, check out what we have going on so far.   Be sure to follow me on my social media platforms as well.
